**Marine Animal Identification Through HUD for Divers**

This project involves creating a Heads-Up Display (HUD) goggle that performs real-time processing for marine animal identification. The project leverages ResNet50 and MobileNetV3 convolutional neural network (CNN) models to recognize marine animals in underwater environments.

**Features**

Real-time video processing
Marine animal identification using ResNet50 and MobileNetV3 CNN models
Heads-Up Display (HUD) integration
